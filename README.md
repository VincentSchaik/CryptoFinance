Bitcoin Stock Price Prediction - Group Project 

Our project is to develop a model to predict prices of Bitcoin using historic data prices
and sentiment analysis so people with limited stock knowledge can do wiser investments,
and informed choices. Due to the fact that Bitcoin is highly volatile, we think sentiment
analysis is going to provide valuable insight into our model.

Our Target is 65% accuracy on next day stock prediction.

## Limitations
Is currently challenging to find sentiment analysis data. Our team decided created a technical baseline
model and we will improve
